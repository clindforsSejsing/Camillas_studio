# Camillas_studio
The first webpage I ever made.  Its deployed and belongs to an artist/tatoo-studio in Kiruna. 

(First version written in only CSS and HTML)- The artist did art and tattoos (styling moore of a tattoo studio).

221004- (javascipt, html, css and bootstrap) update with a new version due to the artist only focusing on prints and art. The only demand was the page to be orange/yellow and have a form that redirects emails from the page. Check out the result: 

You can visit it at: www.camillasstudio.nu /CLS

 (this project is always under construction as the work with the studio is continuous when the artist needs work to be done on it).
